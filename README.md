# Friend-Finder

Purpose:

To build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application aka a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from  users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

How to use:

The user can navigate to the surveys from the home page by clicking on the "Survey" button. This will bring the user to the survey page where the user should enter their name, include a picture, and answer all 10 of the survey questions. Once all fields are completed and the submit button is clicked, a modal with the information of the user who is most compatible appears. 

Dependencies:

npm express, npm body-parser, path
